## Description

This project is the frontend application for a responsive pet adoption web application. The platform must allow users to browse pets available for adoption, view detailed information, and for admins to manage the pet listings (i.e update and delete)

Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front-end pet adoption web application. There is a customer-facing side where users can view pets available for adoption and an admin-facing side where admin users can register or login to manage pets available for adoption.
